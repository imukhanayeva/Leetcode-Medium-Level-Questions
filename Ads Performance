** Ads Performance **

Problem 
# Performance of the Ad is measured using Click-Through Rate (CTR) 
# Round ctr to 2 decimal points. Order the result table by ctr in descending order and by ad_id in ascending order in case of a tie

# For percentage calculation, there is an easy way to use CASE function instead of regular "deviding" method
# The exclusive cases are set as NULL 


Solution:

SELECT ad_id, IFNULL(ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN action = 'Clicked' THEN 1 
                               WHEN action = 'Viewed' THEN 0 
                               ELSE NULL END)*100,2),0) AS ctr
FROM Ads
GROUP BY ad_id
ORDER BY ctr DESC, ad_id ASC
